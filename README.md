## Running the code

1. If you donâ€™t have it please install [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Run `npm run dev` in the project directory.
4. The app should now be running on `localhost:3030` so put that into your web browser and try it out.
