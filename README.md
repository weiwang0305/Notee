# Quilt Labs - Notes Filesystem App Challenge

## Running the code

1. If you don’t have it please install [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Run `npm run dev` in the project directory.
4. The app should now be running on `localhost:3030` so put that into your web browser and try it out.

## Provided code

**Items**

An **Item** can be either a **Note** or a **Directory**. A **Note** is a leaf node in the filesystem and contains a string of text. A **Directory** is a node in the filesystem that can contain other **Items**. The root of the filesystem is a **Directory**.

Schema:

| **Field** | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type      | ‘note’ \| ‘directory’ | Defines whether an Item is a Note or Directory.                                                     |
| name      | string                | The name associated with the Item.                                                                  |
| parent    | Item \| undefined     | A reference to the parent of this Item. undefined for the `root` directory.                         |
| note      | string \| undefined   | The actual notes text that the user can set for `Note` items. undefined when `type == ‘directory’`. |
| items     | Item[] \| undefined   | The items in this directory if the item is a `Directory`. undefined when `type == ‘note’`.          |

This is defined in `app/components/types.ts`.

**Components**

- `ReactApp (app/components/reactApp.tsx)` - The main component that renders the app.
- `Workspace (app/components/workspace.tsx)` - The component that renders the filesystem.
  - This component provides a `React.Context` through which child components can filesystem methods and state.
- `ItemView (app/components/workspace.tsx)` - The component which renders an individual Item.
  - This component is checks the type and renders the correct component for the Item type (Note or Directory).
- `noteView (app/components/noteView.tsx)` - The component which renders a Note.
- `directoryView (app/components/directoryView.tsx)` - The component which renders a Directory.

**React Context**

The `Workspace` component provides a `React.Context` through which child components can filesystem methods and state. This is defined in `app/components/workspace.tsx`.

| **Field**      | **Type**     | **Description**                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| currentItem    | Item \| null | The current item rendered in the `Workspace`.                                              |
| setCurrentItem | Function     | Sets the current item to a different item.                                                 |
| addNote        | Function     | Creates a new note given a `fileName` and `noteText`, if the `currentItem` is a directory. |
| addDirectory   | Function     | Creates a new directory given a `newDirName`, if the `currentItem` is a directory.         |
| updateNote     | Function     | Updates the `note` text of the `currentItem`, if it is a note.                             |

## Thoughts and Journey

**Deleting Items**
I decided to go down the requirement one at a time. I started with Deleting items. Before actually working on the code, I took approximately one hour looking through the code trying to understand it. First things I've noticed was that some hooks were foreign to me.
